	 <p> In our planet approximately <mark>71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water</mark>, more than half than our planet
	 is land. Fittingly nicknamed the <i>'blue planet'</i> or the <i>'watery planet'</i> by others in the science field for this reason
	 Earth is rich in many bountiful marine life and resources that simply cannot be found anywhere else in the known galaxy
	 as the only planet that we know of to house life. </p>

     <p> And yet, despite all these wonders that we boast about that makes the planet unique we are also the <b>driving force
     in its destruction.</b> From the rise to of the industrial revolution around <mark>26% of the ocean has began to acidify</mark> not to mention
     the fact that the <mark>ocean naturally absorbs 30% of all carbon dioxide produced by people</mark>. Marine pollution usually coming from land
     is reaching scary levels, with an <mark>estimated average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter on oevery square kilometre of the ocean.</mark></p>

     <p> Despite this, we as humans depend on the ocean and other bodies of water for our continued survival and economy. From those who
     rely on fish for our food and those fish needing coral reefs to live and survive that we mercilessly destroy by errecting sturctures in the
     ocean and from illegal fishing practices. Not to mention the heating of natural bodies of water due to <b>Global Warming</b> causing bleeching in 
     coral and killing fish that cannot survive the increased global heat. </p>

     <p> <b><i><mark>SDG: 14 "Life Below Water"</b></i></mark> aims to address this by attempting to perserve the ocean, coastal regions and other locations
     by keeping its ecosystems well and thriving and protecting them from the dangers mankind has wrought upon them. This goal also aims to
     address and tackle the impact we've already caused like the </p>
